# Personal PARA Method Setup - Based on Shivam Mathur's Implementation

This document captures the personal PARA method setup based on the article: [Achieving Order in a Busy Life: How the PARA Method Helped Me](https://shivammathur.in/achieving-order-in-a-busy-life-how-the-para-method-helped-me-a276755a3f31)

## Key Personalizations

### 1. Terminology
- Uses **"Areas of Improvement"** instead of just "Areas"
- This emphasizes the active improvement aspect rather than just ongoing responsibilities

### 2. Framework Integration

#### Simon Sinek's Golden Circle Model
- **Why**: Motivation and purpose for pursuing the project/area
- **How**: The approach or method to achieve it
- **What**: The specific actions or deliverables

#### EADPC Model (Prioritization Framework)
- **Eliminate**: Remove unnecessary items
- **Automate**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **Delegate**: Assign to others when possible
- **Procrastinate**: Delay non-critical items
- **Concentrate**: Focus on high-value work

### 3. Project Constraints
- **Maximum 3 personal projects** running simultaneously
- Uses EADPC model to enforce this limit
- Prevents project overload and maintains focus

### 4. Project Plan Template

Every project starts with a **Project Plan** note (takes ~10 minutes to fill):

```
## Project Plan

### Why am I doing this?
- [Motivation/purpose items]

### How will I do this?
- [Approach/method items]

### What am I doing?
- [Specific actions/deliverables]

### Scope
- [What's included/excluded]

### What does complete look like?
- [Definition of done]

### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- ...

### Deadline
- [Specific date]
```

**Example from article:**
- **Why**: To gain clarity in thought and communication
- **How**: Write a blog regularly with active readers
- **What**: Writing an article about PARA method experience
- **Scope**: Limit to personal experience only
- **Complete**: Complete anecdotal article with all modifications
- **Deadline**: Sunday, 19th May 2024

### 5. Plan of Action for Areas of Improvement

Each Area of Improvement has a **Plan of Action**:

```
## Plan of Action

### Why am I doing this?
- [Motivation items]

### How will I do this?
- [Approach items]

### What am I doing?
- [Specific actions]

### Initiatives
- [Ongoing initiatives/actions]

### Projects
- [Related projects, completed and in progress]
```

**Example from article:**
- **Why**: To gain clarity in thoughts and communication
- **How**: Write blog regularly, talk to people, review conversations, improve listening
- **What**: Write blog post every Sunday, purchase co-working space weekly, record meetings
- **Initiatives**: Recording Google Meets with TLDV, booking co-working spaces
- **Projects**: Multiple completed articles, PARA Method article in progress

## Key Principles

1. **Always set a DEADLINE** for projects
2. **Define scope** clearly to avoid scope creep
3. **Define what "complete" looks like** before starting
4. **Limit active projects** to 3 maximum
5. **Use frameworks** (Golden Circle, EADPC) for structure
6. **Track initiatives separately** from projects in Areas of Improvement
7. **Link projects to Areas** of Improvement when relevant

## Implementation Notes

- Started using PARA in August 2023
- Personalized version since September 2023
- Took about a month to get used to the system
- Completed 17 personal projects with 3 Areas of Improvement running
- System has been working smoothly after the initial adjustment period

## Lessons Learned

### Initial Challenges
1. **Projects**: Too many (5-6), no clear end definition, included everything related
2. **Areas of Improvement**: Became like unattainable New Year's resolutions, too long, treated like daily projects

### Solutions
1. **Project Plan template** ensures clear definition and scope
2. **EADPC model** helps limit to 3 projects
3. **Deadlines** ensure projects actually complete
4. **Separate Initiatives from Projects** in Areas of Improvement
5. **Golden Circle** ensures motivation is maintained

## Integration with Plugin

The plugin should support:
1. **Project Plan template** with all required fields
2. **Plan of Action template** for Areas of Improvement
3. **Project limit enforcement** (max 3 active projects)
4. **EADPC prioritization** workflow
5. **Golden Circle** framework integration
6. **Deadline tracking** and reminders
7. **Initiative tracking** separate from projects
8. **Project-to-Area linking** functionality
